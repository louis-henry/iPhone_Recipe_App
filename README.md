# iPhone_Recipe_App
A recipe iPhone application developed during a group project assignment when studying at RMIT University between 2018 and 2021

# About
This was a university group project that was completed by several class members. It's a swift application that was done later within 
the course and was one of the elective units as part of the bachelor degree. I have uploaded simply as a reference to a Swift project 
I have worked on in the past.
